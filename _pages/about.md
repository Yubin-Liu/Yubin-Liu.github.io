I conduct my research under the supervision of [Dr. Panagiotis Angeloudis]&#40;http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.angeloudis/&#41; and [Dr. Jose Escribano-Macias]&#40;http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.escribano/&#41. My research focuses on the application of autonomous delivery fleet in urban logistics, with interests in the intersection of transportation science and supply chain management, particularly in the performance optimisation and evaluation of logistics operations.

I received a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Logistics Engineering and was awarded a China National Scholarship and recognised as a Merit student of Heilongjiang Province in 2017. I earned an MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management from Cranfield University, graduating with Distinction Honors. 

My research have been published in several leading conferences and fleet journals such as Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting, IEEE Conference of Intelligent Transportation Systems, Transportation Research Part A, C, and E. I also received the Best Research Paper Award at the 2023 Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting for my work on the efficient use of autonomous vehicle fleets in urban freight distribution.
